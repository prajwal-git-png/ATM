# ATM Machine Simulation

This project is a **Java-based ATM Machine Simulation** designed to mimic the basic functionalities of a real-world ATM. Built using **Java** and **Swing (JFrame)** for the user interface, this project demonstrates key concepts of object-oriented programming, GUI design, and event handling in Java.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Login functionality to authenticate users securely.
- **Account Management**: Check balance, deposit, and withdraw funds.
- **Transaction History**: Displays a log of recent transactions.
- **Responsive GUI**: Interactive and user-friendly interface for a seamless experience.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation and error messages for invalid transactions or inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for backend logic.
- **Swing (JFrame)**: To create a graphical user interface.

## Purpose
This project showcases:
- Practical implementation of Java and GUI development.
- Problem-solving skills and real-world application simulation.
- Clean and modular code structure for easy understanding and modification.
